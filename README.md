# mcp.run playground

This will be an interactive session! You don't **have** to code to follow along, but if you want, make sure you have:

- a GitHub account (duh, but just saying)
- mcp.run account (you can use the GH account and create it on the spot)
- the [XTP CLI installed](https://docs.xtp.dylibso.com/docs/cli/) (if you want to build servlets) 
- recommended for interactive use: an account with Claude, Claude Desktop installed
- useful for Tasks: an account with Claude (Anthropic Console) and/or OpenAI
- you can also use Ollama/your favorite MCP client (if you like to live on the bleeding edge)
